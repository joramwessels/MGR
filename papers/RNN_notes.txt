feed forward = one directional
fading gradient -> gating (LSTM, GRU)
Decide on length of input sequence
meant for forecasting; outputting a sequence
emulates a FSA, but exponentially more powerful:
	n hidden neurons -> 2^n activity vector
	if bottleneck = representation, better than FSA
	double hidden neurons = squared activity vectors
Vanilla RNNs faded, but LSTM models brought back interest
Seq2seq (aka Encoder/Decoder) models use 2 RNNs simultaneously
	In between is a word embedding algorithm (GloVe, Word2vec)

Electronic music is too diverse to be considered a single target class
I propose a hybrid MGR classifier that is specialized in electronic subgenres,
and that is also able to independently distinguish electronic music from other genres.

MGR almost exclusively considers 5-10 genres to distinguish between.
I suspect humans recognize genres by identifying the specific subgenre before abstracting using their knowledge of music.
Music genres are often organized in a hierarchical fashion.
I propose increasing the amount of subgenres and using a hierarchical genre representation to improve MGR results.

Different approach using CNN/RNN. Directly on the signal?

CNN
https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner's-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/
	- 3 dimensional input
	- Convolutional layer (filters -> activation maps)
	- Activation/feature map

NN Design
	- Sigmoid activation
	- Propability/confidence
	- Hierarchical? Multiple labels?


Evaluation
	- Algorithm -> In context of MGR, other datasets
	- Genre partitioning -> Train on EDM subgenres and other genres, and train on 'Electronic' and other genres (maybe 1 in-between stage)
	- Amount of target variables -> Optimize for EDM subgenres, vary target variables from 1 to 20 and graph results
	- Dataset size -> vary training samples and graph results
