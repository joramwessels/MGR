### Li, 2010
Uses a CNN to distinguish between 10 main genres. It resulted in 84% accuracy
on the training set, but less than 30% accuracy on the test set. Their
explanation: 80 songs can't represent a genre. Their solution: adding affine
transformations and increasing the dataset. I think a CNN will only work on the
lowest level, linking rhythmic features within 2 bars together. All higher
abstractions are useless.
