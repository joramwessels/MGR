# Electronic Music Style Recognition
## Electronic Subgenre Recognition Using CNN-RNN Hybrids
### ðŸ’­ Idea
Previous research on MGR has paid little attention to electronic music. The few studies that did failed to use sufficiently
representative datasets or state of the art neural network algorithms. The idea of the presented work is to create an MGR
system specifically targeted at electronic subgenres using a neural network that combines a CNN with an RNN, and training that
algorithm on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset.
